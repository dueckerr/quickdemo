<p>Through FIMS's free "Pim Tracker", 
    Hydraulic Fracturing companies now have the right tools and
     opportunities to reduce costs through innovative management 
     systems.  PIM Tracker will document what frac pump is being 
     maintenanced, what puDuring the developmental phase, FIM worked on keeping the inputs limited and the user-interface seamless. PIM Tracker will collect and analyze opeations related to pump maintenance.  
     The most direct support PIM will offer is the ability for the FIM's customers to start implementing "Just-In-Time Inventory" methodologies.

<h1>Effects of poor inventory management</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Costly ordering</li>
    <li>Increased Cost</li>
    <li>Poor inventory balance: Part Shortages & Overstocking</li>
</ul>

    The problem FIM is looking to solve is the lack of software designed for the OFS
    market.  The Hydraulic Fracturing market in the United States alone is estimated at $6 billion.  
    A market that large and volatile to maret prices, need to have software
    solutions dedicated to solve their specific problems, and FIM Solutions aims to do this.  Indepented of 
    the size the company, the industry standerd is to use excell spreadsheets, to track operational 
    data.

<p>
    Automation within OFS companies have laged behind.  This has 
    to do with the fact that little to no data is captured and shared
    from the field to the office.  FIM's goal is to change this, first using
    the PIM Tracker to better manage pump components, such as Plungers, Valves, Packing,
    and Seats.  These are the most costly parts associated with pump maintenance, averaging between 
    $100,000 - $300,000 dependent on shale formations and job designs.  This estimated cost does not include waste or
    other expense with regard to inventory management. This is the perverbial "low hanging fruit" FIM Solutions will work to remedy.
